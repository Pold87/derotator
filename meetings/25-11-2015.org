* Convolutional networks

** Repository:
- https://github.com/tudelft/deepdrone

* Textons

** Repositories:
- https://github.com/tudelft/draug
- https://github.com/tudelft/treXton

** Visualizer

- Visualizes texton predictions, filtered texton predictions, and SIFT
  predictions
- Additionally, it shows the pictures during flight and the texton histogram

**  Ground truth labeler using SIFT

- Slow but accurate. Creates a .csv file with x, y coordinates
- Can be used for testing different approaches (fast_test.py) --
  calculates difference between texton predictions and SIFT
- Could be used also used for training (semi-supervised learning):
  Learning with SIFT (and draug), predicting with textons.


** Derotate image based on IMU data (WiFi with libardrone)
- Not tested with treXton yet

** Other improvements
- Visualizer can be used live using a webcam
- Added a Kalman filter
- Training based on draug / based on ground truth labeler
- Different classifiers (random forest regression, nearest neighbors,
  gradient boosting) and combinations of different classifiers
- Added tfidf and global standardization to treXton


** Datasets:
- Cyberzoo (ground truth: SIFT)
- Playing Mat (ground truth: OptiTrack)

* TODO
-  Clean up code
-  Add global configuration file
-  Test treXton with derotator
-  Hyperparameter optimization (for example, number of decisions trees
   or number of textons) and choice of classifiers. Automate that using fast_test.py
-  Add color to textons (see paper: /Color Textons for Texture
   Recognition/)
